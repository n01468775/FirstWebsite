            My name is Thiago Simoes. I'm 22yo, currently based in Toronto, but I'm from Brazil. Current Humber student for computer programming and Analysis Co-op Stream Program.
            I speak 4 languages, besides my mother tongue: english, spanish, korean and mandarin. I've always loved learning new languages and in 2018 I had the opportunity to go to Taiwan as an exchange student and study there for a year. It was an eye opening experience where I could learn a new language and immerse myself in a new culture very different from mine. After that I decided to continue learning languages and, aside from continuing Mandarin, I also started learning korean.
            As an old exchange student, the perspective of meeting and living alongside with new cultures is always an awesome experience, because of that I decided to leave Brazil and come to Canada to pursue a career in programming, a fast expanding industry that attracts me a lot.
